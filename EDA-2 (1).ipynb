    "Used the 'ppscore' library to generate a Predictive Power Score(PPS) matrix for the given dataset 'df'.The 'pps.matrix()' function computes the predictive power between each pair of features in the dataset indicating how well one feature can predict another. The resulting matrix is stored in 'pps_matrix' and then extracted and prints the columns as 'x', 'y', and 'ppscore' to display the predictive power scores between different feature pairs. This helps in understanding the relationships between features, which can guide further feature selection or engineering steps in the analysis."
